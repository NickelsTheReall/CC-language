- Use snake_case for functions and variables.
- Use PascalCase for struct and module names.
- Add clear comments to complex logic.
- Keep your code readable â€” we prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Every .ccla file should include an example or usage note if it introduces something new.

- Reference issues if applicable: Fixes #12
- Include tests if you add new functionality.
- Keep commits atomic and meaningful.
